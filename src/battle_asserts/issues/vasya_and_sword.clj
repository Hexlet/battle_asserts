(def description "Vasya has earned a lot of virtual coins and wants to buy for them a unique sword in the in-game store of his favorite MMORPG. The store is arranged in such a way that the prices of items in it change every day. Today a sword can cost 100 coins, tomorrow - 70, the day after tomorrow - 150.
                  Vasya sword is only needed for a while to make a quest with friends, in the future he is going to sell it with the same store. However, there is another trick in the store: once a player buys an item for a certain price, he cannot sell it in the future for a higher price or equal to the one he made the purchase for. For example, if Vasya buys a sword for 100 coins, he can't sell it for 150 coins.
                  Vasya has got his hands on the sword's price schedule for the next few days, so help him make a deal where he will suffer the minimum loss from resale.

                  The function accepts an array of integer prices for the nearest sequence of `n` days (n < 1000).
Returns the minimum loss from resale.")

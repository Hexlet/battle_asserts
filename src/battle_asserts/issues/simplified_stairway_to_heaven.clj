(def description "`N` dicks randomly spread out of `M` stairs, there can be as many dicks as you want on one step. We gotta go down these stairs.
                  Every time you step on a stair-step with dicks, the infame number increases by the number of dicks.
                  You can go down one or two steps at a time. Write a function to descend the stairs minimizing the infame number (function must find local minimun at each step!).
                  The function receives an array with the number of dicks on each step and returns the minimized infame number.

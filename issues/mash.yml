  Mash is an extended Hash that gives simple pseudo-object functionality that can be built from hashes and easily extended.
  It is designed to be used in RESTful API libraries to provide easy object-like access to JSON and XML parsed hashes.

checks:
  ruby:
    setup: |
      mash = Mash.new
      mash.name = "My Mash"

      mash2 = Mash.new
      mash2.author!.name = "Michael Bleigh"
    asserts:
      - assert !mash.post?
      - assert_equal nil, mash.post
      - assert_equal "My Mash", mash.name
      - assert mash.name?
      - assert_equal "Michael Bleigh", mash2.author.name
      - assert mash.author.is_a?(Mash)

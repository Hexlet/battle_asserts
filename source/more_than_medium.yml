  Write a function that will return the words,
  which are longer than the average length of all the words.

checks:
  ruby:
    asserts:
      - assert_equal ["This", "sample", "string"], more_than_medium("This is a sample string")
      - assert_equal ["another", "sample"], more_than_medium("Some another sample")
      - assert_equal [], more_than_medium("Do, do, do, do... do it!")

  javascript:
    asserts:
      - assertEqual(["This", "sample", "string"], moreThanMedium("This is a sample string"))
      - assertEqual(["another", "sample"], moreThanMedium("Some another sample"))
      - assertEqual([], moreThanMedium("Do, do, do, do... do it!"))

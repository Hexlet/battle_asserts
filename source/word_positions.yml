  Given a text file and a word, find the positions that the word occurs in the file.
  Weâ€™ll be asked to find the positions of many words in the same file.

checks:
  ruby:
    asserts:
      - assert_equal [0], word_positions('test', 'test')
      - assert_equal [0, 4, 9], word_positions('test test test', 'test')
      - assert_equal [11], word_positions('find a word in some sentence', 'in')

checks:
  javascript:
    asserts:
      - assertEqual([0], wordPositions('test')('test'))
      - assertEqual([0, 4, 9], wordPositions('test test test')('test'))
      - assertEqual([11], wordPositions('find a word in some sentence')('in'))

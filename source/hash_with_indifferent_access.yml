description:
  Implement a hash class which does not distinguish between symbols and strings for its keys.

checks:
  ruby:
    setup: |
      composers = HashWithIndifferentAccess.new
      composers[:Janacek] = "Leos Janacek"
      composers["Sweelinck"] = "Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck"

      mathematicians = HashWithIndifferentAccess["Yutaka", "Taniyama", :Alonzo, "Church"]

    asserts:
      - assert_equal "Leos Janacek", composers["Janacek"]
      - assert_equal "Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck", composers[:Sweelinck]
      - assert_equal "Taniyama", mathematicians[:Yutaka]
      - assert_equal mathematicians["Alonzo"], mathematicians[:Alonzo]

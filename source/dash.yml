  Dash is an extended Hash that has a discrete set of defined properties and only those properties may be set on the hash.
  Additionally, you can set defaults for each property. You can also flag a property as required.
  Required properties will raise an exception if unset.

checks:
  ruby:
    setup: |
      class Person < Dash
        property :name, :required => true
        property :email
        property :occupation, :default => 'Rubyist'
      end

      p = Person.new(:name => "Bob")
      p.email = 'abc@def.com'

    asserts:
      - assert_raise(ArgumentError) { Person.new }
      - assert_equal "Bob", p.name
      - assert_equal "abc@def.com", p.email
      - assert_raise(ArgumentError) { p.name = nil }
      - assert_equal "Rubyist", p.occupation
      - assert_equal "Rubyist", p[:occupation]
      - assert_raise(NoMethodError) { p[:awesome] }
